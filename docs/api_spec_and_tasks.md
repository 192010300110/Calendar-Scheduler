## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains main entry point for the application"),
    ("models.py", "Contains the models for the application, including User and Task"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views for the application, including API views for tasks"),
    ("urls.py", "Contains the URL patterns for the application"),
    ("templates/", "Directory for storing HTML templates"),
    ("static/", "Directory for storing static files"),
    ("api.py", "Contains API logic for tasks"),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions for the application"),
    ("tests.py", "Contains unit tests for the application")
]
```

## Task list:

```python
[
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "urls.py",
    "api.py",
    "utils.py",
    "main.py",
    "tests.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains utility functions that can be used across the application, such as functions for sending email notifications.

The 'config.py' file contains configuration variables for the application, such as database settings and email server settings.
